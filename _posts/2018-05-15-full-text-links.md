The [publication list](/publications) now includes a full text link for most papers (<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i>PDF links). For open access papers, this is just the link to the publisher's version and some others are available on arXiv. A few papers are not freely available but for most of them I am allowed to share them privately (e.g. via <a href="mailto:web@wrig.de">email</a>).
